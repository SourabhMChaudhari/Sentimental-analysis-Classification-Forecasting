Right out of the bag it just plain feels odd in the mouth. And although I was happy to see that sugar is kept to a minimum -- 9 grams of sugar (fructose) in each serving – the only sweetness was created by the dried fruit (cranberries and raisins).<br /><br />Other than that little burst of flavor from the fruit, the cereal simply tastes like dust -- well, what I imagine dust would taste like. I am puzzled that I cannot discern the nuts, seeds and coconut – instead it tastes of almost nothing. If grey could describe a food, this would be the food.<br /><br />I hate to throw it away so I will incorporate the two and a half cup bag of muesli into other things, like muffins, pancakes, yogurt, etc. but it really is not flavorful enough to stand alone.

I was excited when I found this option, but didn't read the ingredients as closely as I should have.  Green tea is usually considered a healthy item, but the maker of this tea decided to include sugar in the mix to boost the taste.  Why couldn't they have used stevia leaf as a sweetener instead?  With the sugar in it, it gives each cup of tea 6 grams of sugar.  That's pretty high if you are watching your weight or glycemic index.  I'll never purchase it again because of the sugar.

It is the raw ingredients - oats, fruit, seeds, and nuts - in loose form.  Having tried it, I think it works better that way!  The balance of ingredients and sweetness is well done, with nothing dominating the flavor.  I particularly like the pumpkin seeds, and everything is soft enough to eat with no hard nuts or chunks to wear out my jaw like some almond-heavy granola mixes.  It can be eaten warm similar to an oatmeal or cold like a granola cereal.  The former is more comforting, but the latter is nice for the summer.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be super delicious.  The blueberries are soft and lack that astringent medicinal flavor that some inexpensive berries have.  If the price is low enough, I recommend it.  I may buy this rarely as a comfort food and try to make some of my own as well.\n",

If you do not remove the tea bag and leave it in while you are sipping (as I do), it can become very strong.  And by strong, I mean SPICY.  Not in a good way.  I have to add a lot of splenda to it.  I have not noticed any &#34;detox&#34; qualities and I have been through 2 whole boxes so far.  I typically use 2 tea bags per 14 ounces of boiling water.  I do this about twice daily, sometimes 3 times.  And again, I have not noticed that my body is &#34;detoxing&#34; by outputting more urine or BM's.  What I have noticed, is that this is a good jump start to a diet, because I am no longer craving very many sweets, and I am feeling fuller much faster.  So as a dieting or weight loss aid, I think it's great.  As a &#34;detox&#34;, I don't see it.  I did not purchase my tea from Amazon.  This is $3.48/box at my local Wal-Mart.\n",

The flavor is superb, with the right amount of bitterness that lingers on the tongue.<br /><br />I have gone through three boxes and only the first was not up to par.  Perhaps this was a one time problem.  I would definitely reorder.  FOUR STARS because of the first box.<br /><br />Here's my original one-star review:<br /><br />This coffee is not bold tasting in a good coffee mouthfeel sense. There is no coffee aroma. There is practically no flavor whatsoever, with an acidic bitter finish.  I have had much better artisanal coffee available through Amazon.  I have had much better coffee at fast food joints. Extremely disappointing purchase.\n",

            "We've become addicted to Coombs grade B maple syrup and are serial order-ers, . Living in the southwest, I cannot speak to the science of maple syrup production--just know our taste buds pronounce this to be great-tasting stuff on pancakes. Also, if you enjoy sweetened coffee, try this maple syrup instead of conventional sweeteners. I've found that much less of the maple syrup is needed compared with the honey I formerly used in coffee. The jug stays on the kitchen counter near the coffee pot--just a small amount is perfect, along with a shake of cinnamon, (The syrup hasn't become moldy left at air-conditioned room temperature.)  We're never without a jug of Coombs in the house and even put a bit in a flip-top plastic bottle for use when traveling.\n",

            "Wow- I ordered 500 because it was the best deal and because of the great reviews.  I am SO glad I did.  I've jazzed up my tea (cold and hot) with the lemon (delicious!)  I have used the lemon and the lime in cooking (fantastic on baked chicken or fish) and I've used it in rice, and pudding and frosting!  Have not baked with it yet, but plan to try that.  It's great in mixed drinks, wonderful in fruit salad, super good in yogurt (with honey!).  This is a fantastic product.  I could not be happier- I'm just sorry I did not know about it before.  (Ladies- keep a baggy of these in your purse for restaurants- because I've tired of dirty bar lemons, and now I just use these- it's MUCH tastier, and probably a lot cleaner.  Nice for restaurant tea as well.)  And I love that I will never have rotting lemons on my counter again!\n",

Subsequently, the cheesecakes were all softened, so some of them had gotten squished and SMASHED, and the plastic-wrap covering on them (which was already sliced OPEN from end-to-end on one of the packages!) was mushed into and stuck onto the tops of the cheesecakes and it ended up removing the tops of the cheesecakes when it was removed!

Basically, I've gone almost completely organic at home, making sure that all of my products(or as much as I can reasonably buy,) are at least a bit organic or natural. This Bob's Red Mill Baking soda is absolutely amazing. In terms of cleaning or deodorizing, the results seem to be about the same, but, I've started using it as toothpaste and deodorant for my skin, and I notice HUGE differences in its effective qualities and the way it works for my body. When I use it on my skin, I don't feel any harsh reaction, it feels as natural as baby powder. I also use it for baking, usually I mix it with a little of my [[ASIN:B00OV8ST8W Citric Acid Powder - Ultra Fine Pure Powdered Crystals - Natural Preservative Food Grade Quality (16 oz)]], and I get a great result, super clean flavors that really bring out the essence of whatever I'm baking. A side note: citric acid is another product that, like baking soda, can be used for so many things. I originally purchased this one bag for making bath bombs at home, and since I've gotten it I have used it for baking, making cheese, fruit salads, smoothies, cleaning my kitchen and bathroom, and flushing out bad smells in my garbage disposal. Talk about all purpose! Anyway, I definitely recommend buying this baking soda, especially if you want to fill your home with natural products.\n",

The rest of my family likes them fine though so I guess its just a personal taste issue. I have just been picking them out. Take note though that this doesn't come in 3 one pound bags like the product title states but rather one very large 3 pound bag. It's about the size of a gallon zip-loc bag. There seems to be about an equal amount of the different kinds of the nuts except for the almonds which the bag seems to have a lot more of than the rest of the nuts. This is the same for both bags I've purchased. If you follow the Green Smoothie Diet and try to control your intake, this bag will most likely last a month for one person which in my opinion is pretty good for the price.\n",

            "I cannot express my love for Torani syrups, esp. their Cinnamon syrup.  I was never a big coffee drinker until my Mr bought me a Keurig a few Christmases ago.  Since then, my twice a week treat of buying coffee at little coffee shops or convenience stores (I don't care what coffee snobs say, when it comes to a quick & easy cuppa; Wawa stores have the best coffee, their new Vienna roast is the tits & they have plenty of options to flavor them, but I digress...) & I got in the habit of carrying various powders, pellets, extracts & syrups as I prefer coffee to be flavored.  I had used Torani syrups for other things such as for Italian sodas, over ice cream & desserts & as I saw them used in coffee shops & stores, I started using them in my my coffee at home.  As I'd started being a sort of &#34;mad chemist&#34; with mixing syrups & flavored coffees, I've been glad to buy Torani syrups through Amazon (esp. in 4 packs as it's much more economical in the long run) & have gotten in the habit of carrying some in little containers or plastic bags to use in coffee I buy on the road.<br />  As mentioned, I came up with little &#34;recipes&#34; & figure I'll share a couple of the favorites of mine & friends.  The biggest hit is my cinnamon bun:<br />*keep in mind my &#34;cups&#34; often are about 24 ounces, so if you use smaller cups, you'll need to adjust how much you use due to it being crazy sweet*<br />  Add a dollop of Nielsen Massey Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Bean Paste or other vanilla paste or extract to your cup before pouring/brewing. Swirl it around to cover the bottom of the cup.  Fill cup with coffee & add 2 pumps Torani Cinnamon syrup & 1 pump of French Vanilla (or whichever Torani vanilla syrup you prefer) & add cream/milk to taste & stir briskly.<br />Then there's the favorite of many; Pumpkin Pie.  When stores stop offering it as a flavored coffee, you hear collective groans across the country.  Have no fear though, Torani offers a tasty Pumpkin Pie syrup!  However, after many experiments, I came up with a concoction that is another toe curling delight.  Use a dollop of vanilla paste (LorAnn also makes a fantastic vanilla paste & they offer the next ingredient...) in your cup before pouring/brewing & add few drops of LorAnn Butter emulsion or a butter extract.  Swirl to mix & cover bottom of cup.  Add coffee & use 2 pumps of Torani Pumpkin Pie syrup & 1 of Vanilla or Toasted Marshmallow Syrup.  Add cream/milk to taste & stir briskly.<br />Lastly, my friend calls this flavor &#34;Chocolate Chip Cookie&#34; & it's another fun treat.<br />  Just as with the Pumpkin Pie above, mix the vanilla paste & butter emulsion to cover bottom of cup.  Pour/brew coffee into cup & add 1 pump of Torani French Vanilla (or other vanilla syrup of choice), 1/2 pump of Torani Cinnamon syrup for just a hint of flavor & depending on whether you prefer dark or milk chocolate you can choose between using 1 pump of Torani Chocolate Milano syrup for dark chocolate flavor or a teaspoon of general chocolate syrup - I use Nestle's Quik (as it lacks high fructose corn syrup-HFCS, bleccccccch!), add cream/milk & stir briskly.<br />  My Mr.'s favorite is &#34;blueberry muffin.&#34;  With luck, I am able to find blueberry flavored coffee & then all that is needed is a pump of Torani Vanilla syrup & a dollop of vanilla paste.  When I can't find it, Torani does have a Blueberry syrup (sadly, not available in the 4 pack deals...) & mixing my vanilla paste along with Torani Vanilla (he prefers when I use their Vanilla Bean syrup for this; go figure?) & use 2 pumps Torani Blueberry syrup & 1 pump of vanilla.<br />  As Torani offers so many flavors both with cane sugar (hallelujah!) or sugar free Splenda; you can become your own mad chemist barista!  It's something I have a lot of fun with & my friends are always excited to try whatever weirdness I concoct to make an average &#34;cuppa Joe&#34; less average & more of a treat.  If you use flavored coffee creamers, be aware that they are often overtly sweetened & you will have to adjust how much syrup you use.  You can get creative & see what you can find in your spice rack & baking cabinet for ingredients & inspiration.  My friend makes what she calls &#34;Almond Joy&#34; & mixes chocolate, coconut & almond.  I'm not a big fan of coconut in coffee, but she & many others say it is delicious.  Look at all the different syrups & choose your favorite flavors to start with creating your own.  You can also take a peek & see if you have any extracts/emulsions to mix in & experiment with.  To think, my infamous coffee concoctions all started out from initially using Torani Vanilla & Hazelnut syrups to brighten the flavors of my store bought cups of coffee...mers, be aware that they are often overtly sweetened & you will have to adjust how much syrup you use.

I'm a vegetarian now, and I used to take a lot of fish oils, and so this is a great replacement for fish oils. I use this as an add-in to my protein drinks and also on my salads. It's extremely tasty, and it's a great oil. When I swallow it by the spoonful, it reminds me of fish oil, but it doesn't have any of the fishy taste. It has a kind of nutty, grassy taste, or more just mild flavors. It's really not a strong, powerful oil, so it combines great with pretty much anything.<br /><br />I've found that when I get enough beneficial oil, that I no longer have uncontrollable cravings for ice cream, which is my dessert of choice. So, I've found that using a tablespoon or two of this per day in my diet really helps me to stabilize the rest of my eating, and it helps me with my fitness goals. I'm sure that it gives me a ton of other benefits, too, but the one that I notice the most is cutting uncontrollable cravings.<br /><br />The only bad thing is that you can't cook with it, because it starts to smoke with not very much heat.\n",

            "From the Das Foods website, the Black Lava Salt is “a blend of sea salt and purified volcanic charcoal. This salt is evaporated in above ground pools that are formed naturally from lava flows.” The charcoal in the black lava salt can have a cleansing effect since charcoal (often given as treatment of poisoning) can adsorb toxins. I don’t know if I’d say this is a major selling point – I think the flavor and appearance are the main attractions. The Fleur de Sel de Guerande is my favorite salt from Das Foods and I’m still getting to grips with this black lava salt – the crystals are quite big compared to the Guerande or Alaea salts. However, the black lava salt does dissolve a little bit once you sprinkle it on top of even moist food so it doesn’t end up being too crunchy.<br /><br />I’ve tried it on sprinkled on tomatoes (with olive oil), grilled pineapple, and Theo’s peanut butter cups – they were all great! It looks pretty striking on most foods; the photo shows the Black Lava, Alaea, and fleur de sel de Guerande salts for comparison.<br /><br />The salt is concentrated by natural (solar) evaporation in salt ponds and then harvested by hand, compared to table salt which is usually mined by pumping water into the ground and then evaporating the salt solution using heat. Das Foods also partner with nonprofits, donating some profits to an AIDS foundation and to WomanCraft.  Some would prefer that the container was glass instead of plastic, and I tend to agree, but at least it’s light and recyclable (and a metal lid on a glass container would not be compatible with the salt).<br /><br />So, overall I’ll give it 5 stars gold stars for quality of the product and 5 “green” stars based on the social and environmental aspects of producing it.\n",

Two years ago I had bought 6 oz of their Fleur de Sel De Guerande and when that ran out (it lasted about 18 months) I decided to go for the set to broaden my salt horizons. So far the fleur de sel is my favorite of the three but I haven’t explored all of the options yet and will probably find that they each have their own niches – the alaea salt is good on grilled veggies while the black lava salt is recommended for fish and would look great on sushi too.<br /><br />One thing to note is that they are all finishing salts, intended for either adding to a dish after the cooking/assembly is finished or sprinkling on top of something while cooking. I’ve used the fleur de sel at lot on tacos (it really elevates a humble veggie or bean and rice taco) and have found that it goes really well with fresh herbs, like rosemary or thyme, combined with olive oil. It’s also great on salads. I usually use it sparingly and crush between my fingers as I add it. But I don’t want it completely ground - the little hits of salt and crunch can make a dish much more interesting than if it had been sprinkled uniformly with table salt. I’ve used the black lava salt used on grilled pineapple and it looks and tastes great. The alaea salt is becoming popular as a topping for chocolate desserts and ice cream – it has more crunch and melts more slowly than the other two salts.<br /><br />So, what are these salts actually composed of? Fleur de sel is around 96% sodium chloride, and the remainder is mainly magnesium, potassium and calcium (and traces of other nutrients that all add to the flavor profile). The other two salts are actually made by combining Hawaiian sea salt with either clay or charcoal – the alaea salt is “a mixture of sea salt and Hawaiian Red Alaea, the legendary medicinal clay laden with healthful benefits” while the lava salt is “a blend of sea salt and purified volcanic charcoal. This salt is evaporated in above ground pools that are formed naturally from lava flows.” So these salts are actually quite complex – certainly more than just NaCl. The alaea salt is rich in iron and contains many other minerals (from the volcanic clay) and is widely used in Native Hawaiian cooking and also in blessings. The charcoal in the black lava salt can have a cleansing effect since charcoal (often given as treatment of poisoning) can adsorb toxins.<br /><br />I wanted to also consider the environmental impact of the salt versus the alternatives. On one hand, the fleur de sel is imported from France, so there’s some transportation fuel to consider. However, the salt is concentrated by natural evaporation in salt ponds and then harvested by hand, so there are fuel/carbon savings there that should more than offset the extra transport distance (if comparing to table salt which is usually mined by pumping water into the ground and then evaporating the salt solution using heat). Slate magazine has a basic but useful introductory article comparing the different varieties of salt. The Guerande salt marshes are actually centuries old (80% of them are more than 500 years old and the most recent additions were made over 200 years ago) and are recognized as a heritage site. They are also recognized as a bird sanctuary due to the large number (over 280 species) of migratory birds that use the site. Overall, Guerande is a site that’s maintained to be in harmony with nature and I’m happy to support their ethos by buying their salt. Similarly, the Hawaiian salts are also harvested by hand in a sustainable fashion and mixed with either local clay or charcoal from volcanic ash. Das Foods also partner with nonprofits, donating some profits to an AIDS foundation and to WomanCraft.  Some would prefer that the container was glass instead of plastic, and I tend to agree, but at least it’s light and recyclable (and a metal lid on a glass container would not be compatible with the salt).<br /><br />So, overall I’ll give it 5 stars gold stars for quality of the product and 5 “green” stars based on the social and environmental aspects of producing it.<br /><br />Note that the salts are not iodized, but you’ll probably also use regular iodized salt in the your cooking (and also in any processed or restaurant food) so I don’t think iodine deficiency is a concern (unless you only ever eat home cooked food and only use these salts – even then you can get your iodine from fish, yogurt, milk, eggs, or sea vegetables like kelp or wakame). Since the salts are more flavorful, less is needed compared to cheaper varieties of salt, so it may have the benefit of reducing your salt intake. I normally wouldn’t imagine paying $20 for a few small jars of salt but a single jar can enhance a couple of years’ worth of dishes. I also appreciate that they have more to offer nutritionally than regular rock salt, and that they are harvested sustainably.lastic, and I tend to agree, but at least it’s light and recyclable (and a metal lid on a glass container would not be compatible with the salt).<br /><br />So, overall I’ll give it 5 stars gold stars for quality of the product and 5 “green” stars based on the social and environmental aspects of producing it.<br /><br />Note that the salts are not iodized, but you’ll probably also use regular iodized salt in the your cooking (and also in any processed or restaurant food) so I don’t think iodine deficiency is a concern (unless you only ever eat home cooked food and only use these salts – even then you can get your iodine from fish, yogurt, milk, eggs, or sea vegetables like kelp or wakame).

This makes them great for soups, and if your protein shake is too watery and you want it to be really thick.

I purchased a 10-pack from another source and they were everything desirable about vanilla beans - plump, oily, plable & smelled heavenly. So, since the 10-pack was okay, I figured it was safe to order a larger amount. I ordered a fourth ounce from the same company and for kicks, I decided to order a fourth ounce from Vanilla bean Kings. Vanilla Bean Kings has such a high rating and rave reviews, how could I go wrong?  It arrived in 2 days (arrived on a SUNDAY - can't beat that Prime membership) but I expected plump beans. The beans I received were skinny & sort of hard. These are not what I consider grade A. Ironically, the other company that sent me a grade A 10-pack, as you recall, I ordered a fourth ounce from them, too, their larger pack was a little less than perfect, too.<br />My conclusion is, if you are going to buy vanilla beans, buy the smaller quantities because they probably move of the shelf  faster and therefore are fresher than the larger pack. I guess I'll have a lot of beans to make extract with, I can't imagine these skinny beans having much caviar.pop\n",

Note to self: you must mix milk to enjoy it.<br /><br />Example 1: in a dry glass, add 4 tablespoonfuls of O’boy and 3 tablespoonfuls of Shelf Reliance Non-fat Powdered Milk. Mix them together until they’re uniform. (Clumps will form if unmixed) Then pour 12 ounces (soda can size) of ice cold drinking water and mix.<br /><br />Example 2: in a dry glass, add 4 ½ tablespoonfuls of O’boy. Then pour 12 ounces of cold Broguiere’s 2% milk (you can buy it at Sprouts) and mix.<br />Either way, you will enjoy it. I’ll buy it again.\n",

In recipes I would normally use two leaves, I only use one now.  If I use two, their flavor is overpowering.  So, be careful.  Better to start out with half the amount and add more if you need too.  I originally bought these to put in sashes to place in the pantry.  We had Mill bugs.  I filled 10 of the bags with these leaves and squirted some eucalyptus oil on them.  Within hours, the bugs were crawling out from under the door.  I've seen people say in their reviews that these are not &#34;premium&#34; bay leaves.  I'm no chef, but I can tell you they are very strong, have great flavor, and halfway through the jug, I've only found one leaf that had a spot of something on it.  I highly recommend them.\n",

My only gripe is the sugar content, which is quite high for something you would think would promote better health.  The label says 18g of sugar but that's only for one serving and one bottle has 2 servings per container, meaning it's 36g of sugar total.  That's literally an entire day's worth of sugar in one bottle for men and well over a day's worth for women as recommended by the American Heart Association.  It is cane sugar so it's easier on the digestive system than something like sucralose, but it's still terrible for heart health and causes weight gain, so you should not drink this at all if you don't intend to burn it off in a serious workout session of at least 60 minutes.

A decent amount of the ice quickly melts though, and you're stuck with a watery iced coffee.

Instead of a very hard capsule that gets opened when put in the machine, these come with pods that have the bottoms already open.  Because of this they have to come in sealed baggies, so a bit more waste, a bit more of an inconvenience to use.  However the price is much better.<br /><br />The taste seemed to be on par, these Yrgacheffe ones were smooth and had a good flavor.  I did have issue a couple of times where the machine didn't want to send water down through the capsule, not sure if it was because of the compatible capsules or just my machine having a rough day.<br /><br />Overall it's great there are more options, instead of just the more expensive Nespresso ones, I wish they didn't have to be bagged.\n",

I had my little bit of two or three while my friends rationed out the bag for the three of them (don't worry, they saved me 10 more in case I wanted to join them). I ate 3 and bagged the rest in fear of my rectum. My friends, that night, they dined on gummy hellbears. They devoured majority of the bag and were satisfied in doing so. All's fine and everything. This is night one of the weekend trip.<br /><br />It wasn't until night 2 of this trip of the damned when all hell broke loose. My 1st friend was playing video games when the trumpets of destiny sounded in his lower intestine. It was impressive really, I swear if I had been all the way across the cabin we were in, I still could've heard the war-trumpet formerly known as his guts. He doubled over and started sweating like a pig, he paused the game and waddled over the bathroom. I stood in the hall looking at the door when I hear what sounded like the asspocalypse happening in there. He was chanting Hail Mary's (he wasn't even Catholic!) while what sounded like someone dropping ten large pots (like at summer camps) of dark brown baked beans into that poor toilet. He was crying when the substituted waterfall came to an end. He flushed and fell face first onto the floor outside the bathroom and couldn't move his legs as all of his strength was used up keeping him from turning inside out. He looked up at me, tears streaming down his face. He whimpered a wussy, &#34;help me!&#34; as another wave of chocolate lava was about to hit him. He crawled back inside bawling while in the other bathrooms upstairs and downstairs I hear the same thing. Those poor bottoms.<br /><br />Needless to say, unless you're about to get your prostate checked or colon check with the camera and all, these little mothers will make your night from a fun one to, well, crap.

You get what you pay for with matcha.<br />Especially if the other claims are actually true. Organic and Japanese.<br /><br />The only in between culinary and ceremonial grade matcha that are what they claim that I have found is the maeda-en universal quality and do matcha 2nd harvest.

They are brighter green, sweeter notes, less bitter, and foam up nicely. Still not ceremonial quality (also not $25+/oz) but can actually drink it prepared traditional style.<br /><br />I would buy this Kazu matcha again.

It makes a great chocolate pudding. This summer I tried making fudge pops from a video I saw, and they came out amazing. I also make homemade chocolate which I do often. I buy cocoa butter, melt it, add stevia and some raisins and almonds. Using a glass baking try I pour it on parchment paper, and then let it harden in the freezer. I pour it thin because I like thin chocolate. It only takes about 30 to 40 minutes to harden. And then I store it in containers in the freezer, because I like the hard snap it has or you can store it in the fridge. I've done both. This cocoa powder makes great recipes. Try it out!\n",

This one has 0 net carbs, meaning it has 1g carbs with 1g fiber so they cancel each other out. I only use 1-2 a day, depending on how strong my coffee is that day. Stevia is an acquired taste. I have used this granular form, their regular granular for (without the fiber and probiotics) and the drops and all 3 of them have a slight bitterness but not nearly as bad as others I have tried and I have yet to find one that is any better.

From the PDF about their business on their website:<br /><br />For years NOW Foods has called itself a “Christian Principled” business, which is a reflection of some family members and senior managers.  The phrase “do unto others as you would have them do unto you” became part of NOW’s culture and continues as long as the spirit of our founder, my father Elwood, lives on.  Though we’re far from perfect, and always will be, our agreed-upon ethics are something for me to be<br />proud of.

Usually we pick up the S'mores ingredients (Hershey's chocolate bars, Graham crackers and large marshmallows) separately at the grocery store. This seemed like a convenient way to get our S'mores &#34;fix&#34; so I decided to give this prepackaged kit a try.<br /><br />The chocolate bars, Graham crackers and large marshmallows are basically the exact same thing that we usually purchase separately at the store, so this is a nice &#34;one stop shop&#34; solution to making S'mores at home. This would be a good purchase before a camping trip or as a gift for someone who regularly camps.<br /><br />The only thing &#34;missing&#34; from this kit is sticks to use for roasting the marshmallows over an open campfire. Granted, most people just find sticks at a campsite, but I wanted to mention the lack of roasting sticks just so people know what is or isn't included.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have about this product is that since I ordered this during the heat of the summer months and the box wasn't refrigerated during shipping, all of the Hershey's chocolate bars inside my kit arrived partially melted. That isn't the end of the world for S'mores since you're going to melt the chocolate anyway, but it would have been nice if the chocolate bars hadn't arrived melted ... it's hard to break the Hershey's chocolate bars into smaller pieces for S'mores if the bars have melted and re-hardened into chocolate &#34;bricks.&#34;<br /><br />Don't order this kit during the summer and you should be fine. Alternatively, Amazon could package this kit in a box with dry ice to prevent melting during the summer.\n",

            "I can't really say enough good things about it..  Whether you want to control diabetes, epilepsy, or just lose weight on a ketogenic diet, carbquik is:<br /><br />1. Amazingly versatile<br />2. Does a terrific job tasting and acting like flour in the dishes you cook<br />3. Easy to use<br /><br />Firstly, it's versatile.  You can use it to make desserts (brownies) main courses (chicken pot pie), sides (hot biscuits), and breakfasts (waffles).  Low carb products are often lacking in taste or texture, but it's really difficult to detect that you're eating low-carb doughnuts, for example.  The doughnuts are delicious and have the correct texture.  It's amazing.<br /><br />Secondly, it's delicious.  It's difficult to tell the difference between low-carb pancakes and carbful pancakes.  If you close your eyes and concentrate, you will notice a slight difference in texture, but it's slight, and once you put butter on it, the difference melts away.  I find that carbquik recipes don't need salt, which is amazing, since at ~210g of sodium, one serving of carbquik equals about 1/10th of a teaspoon of salt.<br /><br />Thirdly, recipes with carbquik are amazingly easy, and you can find them on the web.  I personally use:<br /><br />http://www.tovaindustries.com/carbalose/recipe.php<br /><br />where you'll find recipes for things like cannolis, cinnamon roles, and bagels.  Just as example, when I make a pizza crust, I've computed the net carbs at about .9g carbs per pizza.  For pancakes, 1.4g carbs per medium sized pancake.  Blueberry muffins, about 2g of carbs.<br /><br />You can take a cup of carbquik, make a paste out of it with water or heavy cream, and keep it in your fridge.  Whenever you crave something starchy, you can toss in whatever you like: cheddar cheese, lo-han (or whatever sweetener you like) and cinnamon.  Heck, grab some chopped meat, surround it with carbquik paste and make some dumplings.  It's remarkably easy.\n",

The first three or four years or so they were perfect and made excellent company to the gin and dry vermouth in a very cold, very dry martini. (For martini devotees; George Burns, Charles Kuralt, Goldilocks and I would all have given 5 stars and considered them ‘just right.’)<br />They have always been a little pricy but buying them by the case from Amazon they were still good value given their quality. However, the last couple of years the quality has gone downhill. Several olives in each jar now seem to be too hard, too soft and mushy, or missing the pimento. I can only speculate that El Ni&ntilde;o, California’s poor water management, and/or global warming are having an adverse effect on Santa Barbara Olive Company’s quality assurance department. I can buy generic brand stuffed olives of this same uneven quality from Costco for about half the price. Thus my rating decline from five stars to three.

They are a dense, hockey puck shaped cake and have the most wonderful flavor. I was skeptical about the currant cakes, as most currant flavored baked goods I've tried don't taste much like currants, but these have a wonderfully light flavor I could taste even through the jam we used. We tried them chilled and toasted and while both were good, I tended to prefer them chilled as I feel they had a slightly better fruit flavor that way. The only issue I had was trying to get them separated after being chilled, but I would imagine that might be resolved by setting them out ahead of time to warm up a bit before use. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and am seriously considering ordering more around the holiday season to put in gift baskets.  On a side note, I tried the following products with these and felt they went rather well together: [[ASIN:B00NF9B2NM Welsh Brew Tea, Tea Bags, 80-Count Package]] [[ASIN:B003T6Y3G4 Tiptree Quince Preserve 12 oz]]\n",

You get the opportunity to pick out your favorite(s) and then order what you like in quantity.  Unfortunately not so much with this Java Factory Pack.  Many of the K-Cups in this batch came with the tops pushed out, what I commonly call \\\\\"bloated\\\\\". This leads me to believe that it was a batch close to its expiration date and may explain the weak taste. Since they were delivered in an open packing box, there was no expiration date to find, and since I received them several other cups have begun to \\\\\"bloat\\\\\".<br /><br />Obviously shipping out old or poorly stored coffee is not the way to make a positive impact on the potential market.  The Vanilla Dream, Coconut, and Wakey Wakey tasted weak and watery.  There was no vanilla flavor in the Vanilla Dream and while I could smell the Coconut flavor, I couldn't taste it. Both Dark & Handsome and Smooth Caffeinator had a nice smooth taste, and Da Bomb had a bit more punch and flavor.  Da Bomb was my favorite but I'd want to taste another batch before buying it in quantity.<br /><br />Based on this particular batch, I won't be a buyer of Java Factory anytime soon.  The nice folks at Java Factory need to check out their quality control to find out if the problem is with the blending, storage, or shipment of their coffee.  In the meantime I'll stick with my Mad Monkey for the occasional jolt.\n",

I got these, not even expecting that I'd like them. Every time I've tried some variation of organic/vegan/healthy coconut candies or bars, it ended up being terrible.

It tastes like meltingly good milk chocolate, and there is plenty of it. I'd buy a chocolate bar from these guys, in other words.<br /><br />It's the coconut though, that really blew me away. Instead of tiny flakes of pulverized scrap you've eaten your whole life in candy, there was a big chewy knot of delicious, moist, sweet coconut. Not too sweet though, not drowning out the chocolate, but not unsweetened either.<br /><br />This is a candy. If you gave it to a kid they'd have no problems with it.

It does separate into a solid layer of fat on the top of the can, which I normally like. I like to use that as coconut cream in recipes, and if you dump it into another jar and shake vigorously you blend it back to a nice, thick and fluid coconut milk. But I ordered a case of these and each and every one is grey and gritty. Must be something to do with the manufacturing process. No amount of blending gets rid of the grit, and in fact I could never get the water and cream on top to blend together well at all, even when I used a blender. I was going to try to use it up as coffee creamer, but even in the hot coffee it retains it's grit. I have also never seen this particular shade of grey, and I make my own from scratch when I have the time, that is not the natural color of coconut milk.

It has helped our night vision, enhanced our circulation and has had a marked improvement on my husband's inflammation. A previous review states the product is unsafe due to high iron content.  THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE! The old nutritional label clearly listed the nutritional information per 100 grams or 21 tsps. It then separately listed the actual serving size as only 1 tsp. All you needed to do was divide the nutritional information by 21. You would get the iron content then for 1 tsp which is 8.57mg and far from toxic.

It really doesn't matter though, the taste is just crazy good. I'm much more of a 'salt' person than 'sweet,' but I really like the sweetness of this bacon more than anything. There's honestly not a whole lot of saltiness to it.<br /><br />Also, from reading their website they prepare all to order. I absolutely believe it.

I guess it's a matter of personal preference. You really do get a lot for your money with this, which is what attracted me to this purchase. I thought I would try something different. They have a strong lemon taste. I like them better when heated in the microwave about 12-14 seconds. These did seem to be a little dry to me when compared to other Fiber One dessert options. They crumbled and fell apart, as a few other reviewers mentioned. They don't have a &#34;fiber&#34; taste at all, so it's a good option for people trying to get their fiber, not eat a lot of calories and satisfy the sweet tooth (momentarily....haha). They do taste pretty good for a lemon desert bar. I guess there's only so many of these that one can eat because the flavor is so strong in my opinion.    If you're like my doctor and lay out Fiber One bars in the waiting room for patients, this is a great deal. If you're looking for something to eat by yourself daily, you may grow tired of this flavor very quickly.  Had this been the Cinnamon Bun flavor for the same quantity and price point, I would have been ecstatic. The blueberry streusel is a little better than these too, although those have more of a fiber cardboard/jelly taste. Haha I guess if you really LOVE lemon, like you're a huge lemon fan, get these!

I compare this tea with another Japanese Sencha the SA Japanese Green Tea Sen Cha. I think the SA tea is a wee bit stronger but this has more subtle flavors and is enjoyable in its own right.

It's a delicious fruity drink with only 50 calories. Orange pineapple is the perfect mix of orange and pineapple-- and no carbonation so it goes down smooth with no tummy troubles. I love that the energy comes from all natural green tea, too! There's also one serving of vegetables and fruit per can too which is a definite plus! I did receive this to sample/review from #BzzAgent #gotitfree and I'm so happy I got the opportunity. My husband and I both are huge fans and will be adding this to our weekly shopping list. It really is perfect for that little pick me up to help get you through the day. I noticed the energy about 5 minutes after drinking it and it lasted a few hours! I had no problems with feeling jittery, either! It was the perfect amount of energy. The taste was awesome too. I'd love to try the new black cherry kind. My husband said that it was just like drinking pineapple/orange juice. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because to me there was a weird aftertaste. My husband didn't notice it, but it tasted diet to me. However for all the natural ingredients and antioxidants you cant go wrong!\n",

Melatonin does not work. I've tried other products, zero! Also I gained weight because AMBIEN causes me to sleep walk to the kitchen and eat food! My son taped me doing this at 2,3,4 a.m. I decided to try this tea, not expecting much.<br /><br />Did not take AMBIEN and did not eat an hour before drinking. I hate tea, any kind , so wasn't really looking forward to it. Something just told me try it. I drank it, loved the smell of it and mmmmm it tasted good! Really good! All I know is I drank it and I woke up @ 7 a.m.feeling rested, energetic and more focused. I'm 63, it's my birthday so this is the best birthday gift ever! I have survelience cameras in my home so I watched the video of myself, no tossing and turning, no sleep walking, just good restful sleep. I'm so excited about it that I ordered the 14 day detox one to get rid of that extra weight.<br /><br />My Dr. Is happy I e decided to go with natural, holistic steps as the older you get, the higher risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. My 33 yr. old son passed last year. He was drinking those RED BULLS & MONSTER drinks. So many times I took him to the emergency room for heart attack symptoms. The Dr. told me if he didn't stop the monster drinks next time he would be seeing my son at the morgue and he was right! :( if you need something for focus or energy go with this product or other offers on Amazon! If you like tea this BAETEA is 10 stars! I just tasted the detox one and it's delicious too!  To good health!!!!!\n",

I try to choose healthier options when available, especially when there's an opportunity to buy something without high fructose corn syrup. I believe that is at the root of our health crisis in the US....processed garbage and high fructose corn syrup in everything. I was worried about the taste of this. I'm very picky about the taste of ketchup, and as sad as it sounds, I would rather have unhealthy ingredients than sacrifice the original flavor that we have all grown up to know and love.  Original Heinz is the only brand I have ever liked. Hunts is not an option EVER! I LOVE this organic version from Heinz. I honestly cannot taste any difference whatsoever from the original version. None!!! I was also concerned that it may expire faster than the other version, but the expiration date is stamped 2016.<br /><br />I'm very impressed with this product, and I'll continue buying Organic Heinz Ketchup as long as it's available. Great job Heinz. Not a bad price from Amazon. Delivery and packaging is exactly what I have come to love and trust from Amazon.\n",

            "This variety pack does just that...it offers a wide range of different choices for coffee.  I've now tried each one, and here is my assessment.<br /><br />My two favorites by far are Da Bomb and Dark and Handsome.  I like a rich, robust cup of coffee, and these two flavors deliver that without being over the top. Received nine Dark and Handsome pods, and seven Da Bomb pods (see photo).<br /><br />The two flavored choices, Vanilla Dream and Choconut, have a nice enhancement for each of these flavors, but it is kept somewhat subtle.  I liked both, but they were both more medium roast than bold.  I think they'd be better if they were a little stronger and richer in flavor.  Received four Choconut and three Vanilla Dream.<br /><br />Smooth Caffeinator is for everyone in-between, someone who doesn't like a bold flavor but also doesn't like their coffee on the mild side.  It was okay, but too light for my taste, appreciating that everyone's opinion may be a little different.  Received nine pods in total (they're split in the photo).<br /><br />Wakey Wakey was by far my least favorite.  I can't even call it coffee....it was more like colored water.  I probably won't even finish these, and I know my wife won't...she likes coffee that you can stand a spoon up in.  I've no idea why they called this one Wakey Wakey....Sleepy Sleepy would be more like it.<br /><br />Bottom line here is that if you have a household that likes a variety of strengths of coffee, plus coffee that is flavored as well as non-flavored, or if you are that way yourself, then this is a good choice.  I'm not sure if the count for each type that I received is standard or if it is luck-of-the-draw, but if I were going to order these again I wouldn't want to take a chance on getting too many of the Wakey Wakey flavor.  I wouldn't hesitate, however, to place an order that is purely composed of Da Bomb and/or Dark and Handsome.  Those are excellent.<br /><br />I hope this review helped you in your buying decision....if you have any questions please let me know and I will do my best to answer!\n",

I have health &#34;snobs&#34; in my family who delight in telling me my healthy version of anything is terrible and you only live once.  (Get my drift?)  That's just my family.  So when I do make the occasional sweet treat, I use this flour and they cannot tell.  I have had comments like this one...&#34;Ok mom,  this is why we can't eat your gluten free junk...nothing tastes like the real thing!&#34;.  Well I have been getting the last laugh using BB GF flour and cake mixes.  I also have started using their breading mix for chicken tenders with similar comments from family.  I would give it TEN stars if I could.  That's how good this product is.  I know it costs a little more, but it is worth a LOT more!  Happy baking!

I can easily whip up something much more satisfying by making frosting, mixing together (cold or hot) cocoa powder, vegan butter or refined coconut oil, vanilla, powdered sugar, salt, and soy milk.

I have been using them but what a pain ... I make a 4 ounce cup, remove the k-cup and replace it with a second one and make another 4 ounces in the same cup. Using two k-cups it makes a very good cup of mild coffee, but I only get 40 cups of coffee out of a box instead of the expected 80, along with the hassle. I'm not normally one to complain and will usually only give good reviews, but am giving this one due to the bad Victor Allen customer service. I was so frustrated with the half full k-cups that I did contact the company and ask if I could have gotten a bad batch.

I only discovered this when I made a pizza with the mozzarella and broke out in terrible hives fifteen minutes after finishing a few slices.  I am very allergic to MSG.  The new ingredients are autolyzed yeast, soy protein, and a few others that are a source of glutamic acid which forms MSG when it combines with free sodium, supplied by the salt in these products.  Avoid these cheeses, if you are allergic to MSG.  They used to be my favorite cheeses, as I'm vegan, but now I can't eat them. UPDATE, 9/18/15: Added two stars. This company is now making a mozzarella without MSG, or, at least, without anything that triggers my MSG allergic reaction. It comes in a plastic form-fitting tub, of sorts, with a peel off top.

Even after his diagnosis and beginning treatment, food did not taste good, and it was difficult to help him rebuild muscle from the 35 pounds that he lost.<br /><br />As a result, it was very hard to get him to drink the larger bottles of Boost and Ensure. By concentrating the nutrition into the smaller size, it makes a huge difference in the ability of someone who needs Boost as a diet supplement to more easily get the protein they need. This is particularly true for seniors with small appetites as well as others who are ill.<br /><br />Today, after months of Physical Therapy and carefully moderated medication, he is on the &#34;up side&#34; and is doing well. But we still keep Boost around to ensure that he always gets enough protein.<br /><br />It is easy to be critical of the compact nature of these, unless you really need a compact protein source.\n",

            "This is the real deal, and it is very healthy.  I have went through at least a dozen tubs of Amazing Grass Green SuperFood Original Powder, and it consistently ranks as a #1 seller of this type of product for a reason.  As far as ingredients and quality goes, this is hands down the best greens powder that I have found.  It is raw whole food.  It contains organic (and non-GMO) wheat grass, barley grass, alfalfa, spirulina, spinach, chlorella and broccoli.  Please see the label pictures at the top of the page for this product for a lot more information than I have provided.  It is also very reasonably priced for what it is -- and it is very easy on my stomach!<br /><br />Of course, taste is usually an issue with products such as this.  My advice is this...if I mix it with water, then it is horrible...but when mixed with grape or orange juice, then it is quite drinkable.  It is as simple as that.  They can't really make a greens powder taste good, much as they may try, as they always seem to taste off to me.  If they do make a greens powder taste good, then they dramatically dilute it down with other ingredients, and that defeats the purpose.  Also, it is slightly gritty when mixed as some complain about, but that is unavoidable with a product like this.<br /><br />I can understand it if it doesn't agree with someone's stomach or something like that, but here is no reason for taste or texture excuses.  Just try mixing it with a strong flavored fruit juice, as I mentioned earlier, to help mask the taste (and orange juice with pulp helps mask the texture).  That's probably not a perfect solution for everyone, but it truly makes a world of difference versus mixing it with water.<br /><br />Besides, it's time to grow up!  Isn't it?\n",

I also sometimes have trouble finishing a whole roll of those by myself and still enjoying the taste.  In my opinion, these are the perfect size Smarties.\n",

            "I have bought this off their site and have used it as a primary food source for a couple months.  First off, I have to say if you have had a tooth pulled, this is perfect until you are ready for solids.  Also, if you are sick and can't hold down solids this is perfect.  And for a fast meal to take with you going out and about, again...a great idea.  I love the taste. But where I had an issue with this product is that they use Sucralose.  If you type in about this artificial sugar you will see there is reason for concern, especially with a product promoted as something one could live on.  The company states it doesn't have a lot of this sweetener in it, but that isn't the point.  This product has the sweetener to hide the taste of the vitamin/minerals.  Okay, then keep any sugar out, real or artificial, and let each individual decide how they want to sweeten this...how much...and with what!  I had this sent monthly, but cancelled due to this and am now trying to find a way to make a good tasting substitute to this with healthy vitamin/minerals protein, etc...that's healthy.  I don't do gluten, corn, or soy...so finding something that works equal is a challenge, but I don't use artificial sweeteners.  UPDATE: Received a product answer that there are only 15 milligrams Sucralose in each package of Soylent.  I have not found anything comparable, so reordered from them again.  15 milligrams is very low, and regardless of concerns there is no proof yet that Sucralose will cause issues as other artificial sweeteners have.  Very willing to continue with this product.\n",
